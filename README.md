# C# Practice
This project contains a collection of C# programs that I have written to practice C# programming and prepare for interviews. The programs cover a range of topics, including:

- Classic interview-style problems, such as searching and sorting algorithms, data structures, and algorithms for string manipulation and pattern matching.
- Various design patterns, including the factory design pattern.
- Object-oriented programming principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

To run the programs, you will need to have a C# development environment, such as Visual Studio, installed on your computer. Simply open the solution file in Visual Studio and run the programs from there.

I hope you find this project useful as a resource for learning and practicing C# programming. Happy coding!
